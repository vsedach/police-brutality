### Police fatally shoot unarmed 22 year old | June 1st

"Police in northern California fatally shot an unarmed 22-year-old who was on his knees with his hands up outside a Walgreens store while responding to a call of alleged looting, officials said... An officer in the city of Vallejo was inside his car when he shot Sean Monterrosa on Monday night amid local and national protests against police brutality. Police said an officer mistakenly believed Monterrosa had a gun, but later determined he had a hammer in his pocket... 'When confronted by the police, he dropped to his knees and surrendered, and they fired at him,' said Melissa Nold, a Vallejo civil rights attorney representing Monterrosa’s family. 

Six officers fired 55 bullets in 3.5 seconds; police investigation determined this use of force 'reasonable.'

### Police target, follow and arrest protestor | June 4th

On June 4th, Conrad James, a prominent protestor in Raleigh, threatened to file a class action lawsuit against the Raleigh police departments.

In the early hours of the morning on June 5th, men in black, without visible badge numbers, raided James' home and arrested him for allegedly failing to return a rental car. James denies these claims. The arrest took place in a county under the jurisdiction of the Wake County Sheriff's Office and the Fuquay-Varina Police Department. The sheriff's office, the Fuquay-Varina Police, and the Raleigh Police give differing accounts about the departments involved and the time at which the raid took place.

Police scanner audio shows that Raleigh police officers were following him during protests later that day.

### Philadelphia Police Trap Protesters on Highway, Then Tear Gas Them and Shoot Rubber Bullets | June 1st

An estimated 3000-5000 protesters moved onto Interstate 676, stopping traffic. Protesters move into a tunnel under 20th street. An eye-witness states that officers inside the tunnel (eastbound on I-676) began shooting rubber bullets and macing protesters without any warning or any instructions to halt the protest on the highway. Protesters clear the tunnel, many kneel and put their hands up. Police shoot tear gas at protesters to disperse the crowd, they escape to the hill between 20th and 21st street as there was tear gas westbound on the interstate and they were still being fired at by officers in the tunnel to the east. Some throw canisters back. Officers chase protesters up the hill and appear to detain a number of them. Other officers continue to fire tear gas on to the hill, despite the only visible escape from the tear gas being over a ~10 ft fence.

Medics attempt to treat the young woman while police throw flash bang grenades directly into the first aid center where they are gathered. Several times the victim stops responding or breathing but becomes responsive again after CPR. 911 could not send an ambulance. Eventually a civilian transports her by car to an Emergency Dept where she was delivered with a pulse. The person who filmed the incident from his workplace office is an editor at the local alt weekly, The Stranger; he reported in his twitter thread that the people in the office were having trouble breathing from teargas or some other chemical agent.
