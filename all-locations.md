### Police shoot man filming them with what were allegedly rubber bullets | (believed to be) May 31st

A man was filming police walking down the street and making comments like "that [rifle] better be on safety" towards them. Most officers continued walking down the street, while another ran towards him yelling "hands up" and shooting him with what were allegedly rubber bullets. The officer shot him once, causing the man's arm to bleed, then after a few moments shot him again in the leg. Blood can be seen dripping through the man's pants, which were clearly torn by the projectile.
